# hello-world
Could be anything, but most likley it just sais hi.

Tutorial sais I should write a bit about myself. I work at a company called Nethouse as a software developer. 

I like to say I work with errors, but the marketing people tend be a bit sceptical to that wording. I like it because it encompasses a lot of what I've been doing at work. Starting with a reported issue and figuring out if it's cased by misunderstanding in how to use the system, a programming mistake, a design misthink or potentially clever user behaviour that isn't supported and thus leads to unexpected results. Working with errors isn't everything I do though, of course, but it's still a case of very few words describing a lot, which from a coder's perspective is elegant.

I play a lot of games, and I remember clearly hearing about a known bug in a game that was never fixed, first because it was hard to isolate, and later when several community members knew exactly how to reproduce it because there was no longer any money for development. I remember thinking I want to be a guy who fixes such things, and for a while I've actually been that. Not doing it in games, but similar. Turns out I'm very good at it.

Unfortunately this has also meant that I've seen the other side of things not getting fixed. There's so much to fix and limited funds, so some things just don't get the priority assigned that allows me to work on it.

Right now I am in the unusual situation of not having anything to work on that someone would pay my company for, so I'm using this time to learn how to use github and do some experiments to try to figure out better ways to code.
